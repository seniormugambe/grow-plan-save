‚Ä¢ 20% for savings ($${((this.financialContext.monthlyIncome || 0) * 0.2).toLocaleString()}) - future you will thank you!

4Ô∏è‚É£ Your retirement goal shows you're thinking long-term - compound interest is going to be your best friend! ‚è∞

The "Debt Avalanche" method is mathematically optimal:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Pay minimums on all debts (never miss these!)
2Ô∏è‚É£ Throw every extra dollar at the highest interest rate debt first
3Ô∏è‚É£ Once that's gone, attack the next highest rate

üí° Quick rule: If you have credit card debt (usually 18-25% APR), prioritize that over investing. But for lower-interest debt like mortgages (3-7%), you can often invest while making minimum payments.

Your strong cash flow of $${((this.financialContext.monthlyIncome || 0) - (this.financialContext.monthlyExpenses || 0)).toLocaleString()}/month gives you amazing flexibility! You're in control here! üí™`,

Here's the savings rate breakdown:
‚Ä¢ 0-10%: Getting started üå±
‚Ä¢ 10-15%: Good progress üëç  
‚Ä¢ 15-20%: Excellent work üåü
